        Cyber Security is the techniques of protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unauthorized access or attacks that are aimed for exploitation. This affects you much more than you think. For example, hackers can hack into your car, a plane, even life support. This is why you need to understand how to protect yourself in this new cyber world. This site will help you understand how to protect yourself by giving you a guide to cybersecurity, check how secure your password is, and encrypting text.

       Staying safe on the internet seems hard, but it is much easier by having someone who has dedicated their life to cyber-security. Cyber-security is the protection of internet-connected systems (hardware, software, and data) from cyberattacks.

       They take time to create software that will prevent hackers from accessing your data. The job of people who have a in this field have an incredibly difficult task because threats constantly evolve and change.
        Luckily some people with the same talents as hackers work to fix vulnerabilities in the devices we use daily. With people that can think the same as hacker, we have a stronger guard from people who steal data.

          At home and in the Corporate world, there are multiple things you can implement daily for your peace of mind from the issue. Application security in the most basic terms is the use of software, hardware, and procedural methods (infosec) to project apps from external threats. Using software is the most common way of protection in the cyber world. While hardware (physical items) are used in high-end systems. Your best bet, in general, would be to using Anti-virus software like Norton or Kaspersky. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Just to make sure you are not on the brink of being hacked, you should change your passwords every month or so to prevent hackers from being able to catch on to sustained passwords. When creating passwords, try to make them without dictionary words or common number schemes.

          Here's a couple of things to do on your social media and technology devices to stay safer:
          <p/>
          <br>
         <div id="ordered"> 
          <ol>1.Two-Step Verification</ol>
          <ol>2.Back-up Data</ol>
          <ol>3.Keep and Up-to-Date Antivirus software</ol>
          </div>
          <br>
         <p class="description"> 
          Two-Step Verification is a simple thing to opt into which prevents hackers from getting into your account using a single password. It lets your secondary recovery method to able to input a software as well. This makes the hackers job nearly impossible unless both devices/accounts are stolen. Back-up Data, at home, helps for not only protecting your device, but for transferring information between devices. It allows a previous version of your potentially stolen data to be restored. This feature is in almost every app that has information or save files associated with it. Finally, keeping an Up-to-Date AntiVirus software is quite important. Although previously mentioned, constantly updating a software can protect from the attacks that update right with your Antivirus.

        what to watch for
      </h2>
        
      <br>
      
      <p class="description">
        Ransomware is a type of malware using an attacker holding the victim's files "hostage", usually via encryption, and demanding a payment to get them back. Using one of these recovery plans we can regain the lost data. 

        The simplest way to attack someone is through Social Engineering. Social engineering is an attack that relies on human interaction to trick users into breaking security procedures in order to gain sensitive information that is typically protected. This is usually used by promising a service or product in exchange for this info.

        Malware, one common but not the easiest ways of harming a computer, is software that enters a computer through accidental downloads. Using worms, Trojan horses, or basic computer viruses they can get into a computer's files. Another software that is more dangerous than just accessing files is Spyware.
      
        Spyware watches your computer and keystrokes where the hacker can find your password. Different types of spyware are password stealers which collect data of your passwords and can access your accounts using those passwords. 

        Another virus is Adware. Adware is the process of embedding a virus into an advertisement hence the name. You have probably been targeted by adware when you get a message saying, "You have won $10,000, click here to claim your prize" or subtle variations, even when you have not signed up for something. The easiest way to avoid this is to stay away from random, unusual advertisements.

        email
      </h2>
      <br>

      <p class ="description">
        According to the Federal Communications Commission, over 60% of email is documented on spam. Email is the primary method for spreading viruses and malware. Sending fake email pretending to be trustworthy is Phishing. Phishing is a form of fraud where fraudulent emails are sent that resemble emails from reputable sources; however, the intention of these emails is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card or login information. You can easily prevent this by using an email filtering service. Some email providers already provide this. 
      </p>
      
      <p class = "description">
        When sending sensitive information in an email, try to use an encrypting service to protect that information. Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable format to prevent disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Email itself isn't always the most secure.

        recovery
      </h2>

      <br>

      <p class ="description">
         Moving on, disasters can be recovered from quickly although it is a little unfamiliar. A Disaster Recovery Plan(DRP) or a Business Continuity Plan(BCP) are common in businesses to reverse the effects of the damage caused. These documents are structured approaches with instructions for responding to unplanned incidents. It usually involves back-ups of previous versions of software or documents. BCP's and DRP's are most effective against Ransomware.
